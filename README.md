# Spotify-API

<h2>Overview</h2>
An interface that allows users to search artists and albums as they would do with Spotify using AJAX to make requests to the API. Clicking any search result will redirect the user to the related artist/album's Spotify page.


<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
     <li> A message will display if there are no results for a search. </li>
     <li> A default image will display for results that do not have any images. </li>
     <li> Infinite scroll is possible.
        <li>  Infinite scroll allows the user to scroll down to the bottom of the listed results and the next page of results will automatically be loaded and appended to the latest results. As part of this functionality, the 'More' button disappears.
        </li>
    </li>
</ul>
